### About the website
Weather-API is a simple weather project built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript vanilla using an API from openweathermap.org

Users can obtain the current temperature of a specified city by either entering its name in a prompt popup or accessing the default city temperature, which is set to Casablanca.
